# connect4
Implementation of connect4, connect4 gameplay AI, computer vision system for connect4 board identification.


This is a cool project that I worked on. It is split into two parts: computer vision identification framework which identifies the game state from images 
and the gameplay ai. 
- The computer vision component is based off a framework devised by [Matt Jennings](https://mattjennings.co.uk/portfolio/Connect-Four%20Computer%20Vision%20A.I/)
- The gameplay ai is a hard-coded version of mcts. (Monte Carlo Tree Search)
