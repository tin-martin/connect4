# Connect4 AI system for Real-world Gameplay
For my IB Personal Project, I created a connect 4 gameplay ai (mcts) and computer vision framework for playing connect 4 with AI in-real-life.

- The computer vision component, based off [a framework devised by Matt Jennings](https://mattjennings.co.uk/portfolio/Connect-Four%20Computer%20Vision%20A.I/), allows the computer to read the state of a real-world board.
- The gameplay ai is a hard-coded version of mcts. (Monte Carlo Tree Search) which provides the best piece placement denoted by the blue-edged piece on the display.
